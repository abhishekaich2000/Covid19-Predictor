# Covid19-Predictor
In this project, We gonna see how we can predict COVID-19 total-cases and new cases using machine learning. We will use a supervised learning algorithm known as "polynomial regression". This is a simple project made for beginners who wanted to see the use of polynomial regression

This model predicts total cases and new cases of cases on the basis of days count and previous cases
